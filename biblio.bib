   abstract = {The molecular pathogenesis of chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer (NK) cells (CLPD‐NK) is poorly understood. Following the screening of 57 CLPD-NK patients, only five presented STAT3 mutations. WES profiling of 13 cases negative for STAT3/STAT5B mutations uncovered an average of 18 clonal, population rare and deleterious somatic variants per patient. The mutational landscape of CLPD-NK showed that most patients carry a heavy mutational burden, with major and subclonal deleterious mutations co-existing in the leukemic clone. Somatic mutations hit genes wired to cancer proliferation, survival, and migration pathways, in the first place Ras/MAPK, PI3K-AKT, in addition to JAK/STAT (PIK3R1 and PTK2). We confirmed variants with putative driver role of MAP10, MPZL1, RPS6KA1, SETD1B, TAOK2, TMEM127, and TNFRSF1A genes, and of genes linked to viral infections (DDX3X and RSF1) and DNA repair (PAXIP1). A truncating mutation of the epigenetic regulator TET2 and a variant likely abrogating PIK3R1-negative regulatory activity were validated. This study significantly furthered the view of the genes and pathways involved in CLPD-NK, indicated similarities with aggressive diseases of NK cells and detected mutated genes targetable by approved drugs, being a step forward to personalized precision medicine for CLPD-NK patients.},

   abstract = {The tiger mosquito is a key vector of several human diseases and is considered a public health concern worldwide. The implementation of strategies aimed at maximizing mosquito control without affecting non-target insect groups is of major importance. In a field trial, we tested the efficiency of a natural pyrethrum-based vs. a synthetic pyrethroid-based insecticide in reducing tiger mosquito population and how they affect the diversity of non-target flower-visiting insects in green urban areas. Only the pyrethroid insecticide was effective in reducing mosquito abundance, although its effects disappeared nine days after application. The two adulticides did not significantly affect the diversity of flower-visiting insects, probably because of their large body size and the difference in flying and foraging activity. To effectively control mosquito populations while preventing intoxication of non-target flower-visiting insects, adulticide applications should be applied early in the morning and only on bushes and trees. Results from our small-scale applications cannot be extrapolate when larger areas are treated.},

Application of gel baits is one of the most efficient management methods. This study investigated the effect of 3 commercially available Imidacloprid gel baits on the palatability of dead cockroaches and, consequently, on the efficacy of secondary killing. German cockroaches killed by the gel baits and others killed by freezing were offered to conspecifics, the numbers of cannibalistic cockroaches and dead cockroaches, as well as weight loss were recorded. Despite the content of Imidacloprid is identical in all the baits, the palatability of the cockroach killed by the gel consumption and used as food was different between the 3 commercial products, with consequences on the secondary killing effect. These results suggest as the bait co-formulants play an important role not only on the palatability of the bait but also in the palatability of the dead cockroaches which are eaten by conspecifics, and therefore, in the result of a pest control application.},

Different hypotheses have been proposed on the original events triggering NK cell hyperactivation and transformation, including a role of viral agents. In this perspective, we revise the lines of evidence that suggested a pathogenetic role in LGLL of the exposure to retroviruses and that identified Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) in other NK cell leukemias and lymphomas and focus on the contrasting data about the importance of viral agents in CLPD-NK. EBV was detected in aggressive NK leukemias but not in the indolent CLPD-NK, where seroreactivity against HTLV-1 retrovirus envelope BA21 protein antigens has been reported in patients, although lacking clear evidence of HTLV infection. We next present original results of whole exome sequencing data analysis that failed to identify viral sequences in CLPD-NK. We recently demonstrated that proliferating NK cells of patients harbor several somatic lesions likely contributing to sustain NK cell proliferation. Thus, we explore whether “neoantigens” similar to the BA21 antigen could be generated by aberrancies present in the leukemic clone. In light of the literature and new data, we evaluated the intriguing hypothesis that NK cell activation can be caused by retroviral agents located outside the hematopoietic compartment and on the possible mechanisms involved with the prospects of immunotherapy-based approaches to limit the growth of NK cells in CLPD-NK disease.},

No studies have compared the clinical efficacy of different mAbs against Omicron VOC. Methods The MANTICO trial is a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical efficacy of bamlanivimab/etesevimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, and sotrovimab in outpatients aged 50 or older with early COVID-19. As the patient enrolment was interrupted for possible futility after the onset of the Omicron wave, the analysis was performed according to the SARS-CoV-2 VOC. The primary outcome was COVID-19 progression (hospitalisation, need of supplemental oxygen therapy, or death through day 14). Secondary outcomes included the time to symptom resolution, assessed using the product-limit method. Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard model were used to assess the association with predictors. Log rank test was used to compare survival functions. Results Overall, 319 patients were included. Among 141 patients infected with Delta, no disease progression was recorded and the time to symptom resolution did not differ significantly between treatment groups (Log-rank Chi-square 0.22, p 0.895). Among 170 patients infected with Omicron (80.6 BA.1, 19.4 BA.1.1), two disease progressions were recorded in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group and the median time to symptom resolution was 5 days shorter in the sotrovimab group compared to bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab (HR 0.526 and HR 0.451, 95 CI 0.359 - 0.77 and 95 CI 0.303 - 0.669, p 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions These results confirm the in-vitro data of superiority of sotrovimab versus casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab/etesivamab in reducing the time to recovery in patients infected with Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1, while no difference was detected in Delta infections. Casirivimab/imdevimab seems to maintain a role in preventing severe COVID-19 in the Omicron population. Adaptive clinical trials comparing mAbs by VOC should be pursued to promptly inform clinical recommendations.

   abstract = {Background: The omicron variant has spread globally at unprecedented speed due to a combination of epidemiological and virological factors that still need to be fully unraveled. Although boosting of immunity in vaccinated populations has proven to increase the antibody recognition for this variant, we still ignore the impact that this intervention has on protection from infection and disease.<br><br>Methods: Relying on a live virus neutralization assay and a commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay targeting antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the parental Spike protein, we tested the efficacy of homologous and heterologous booster vaccinations in inducing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 parental, delta, beta and omicron variants by history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and age of population. Booster vaccination was performed with the BNT126b2 vaccine, while individuals who underwent heterologous booster vaccination were primed with the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine. Moreover, we studied the impact that prior immunity has on vaccination, in mildly infected individuals who received 2-3 doses of the BNT1262b vaccine at different times after infection. Children previously infected with delta were evaluated 3·5 months after infection. To translate neutralization data into estimates of protection, we relied on published predictive models and inferred variant-specific thresholds of protection for both assays and assessed the accuracy of the commercial assay at identifying highly protected individuals.<br><br>Findings: We confirm that boosting significantly restores the ability of antibodies to recognize omicron and other variants, and that the homologous protocol with the BNT126b2 vaccine achieves higher and more broadly reactive neutralizing antibody titers, than those observed among individuals who crossed-over vaccines. On the other hand, mild prior infection with the parental virus and subsequent homologous vaccination with BNT126b2 induces high antibody levels, but with moderate breadth of response, while children aged 5-11 show negligible neutralizing antibodies against the omicron variant few months from infection. Neutralizing and binding antibodies correlate across all variants and allow the identification of variant-specific anti-RBD thresholds for 90 protection efficacy.<br><br>Interpretation: Boosting with the BNT126b2 vaccine is an immediate and effective measure to increase the protection against omicron, in naïve, as well as in previously infected individuals. Identification through serological commercial assays of thresholds of protection against the omicron and delta variants is a crucial step towards large-scale serosurveys to finely assess infection risk both at population and individual level. <br><br>Funding Information: This publication was supported by the ORCHESTRA and VERDI projects and has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreements No. 101016167 and No. 101045989.<br> <br>Declaration of Interests: The authors have no conflict of interest.<br><br>Ethics Approval Statement: The studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and authorized by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Padova (study 1, protocol number 7862; study 3 protocol number 70714) and the University of Verona (protocol number 884 and 3199) and Istituto Nazionale Lazzaro Spallanzani, Rome, Italy (protocol number 436).

At the beginning of 2016, the H9N2 Avian influenza virus (AIV) was detected in Morocco for the first time; despite the implementation of vaccination strategies to control the disease, the virus has become endemic in poultry in the country. The present study was carried out to investigate the origins, zoonotic potential, as well as the impact of vaccination on the molecular evolution of Moroccan H9N2 viruses. Twenty-eight (28) H9N2 viruses collected from 2016 to 2021 in Moroccan poultry flocks were isolated and their whole genomes sequenced. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses showed that Moroccan H9N2 viruses belong to the G1-like lineage and are closely related to viruses isolated in Africa and the Middle East. A high similarity among all the 2016–2017 hemagglutinin sequences was observed, while the viruses identified in 2018–2019 and 2020–2021 were separated from their 2016–2017 ancestors by long branches. Mutations in the HA protein associated with antigenic drift and increased zoonotic potential were also found. The Bayesian phylogeographic analyses revealed the Middle East as being the region where the Moroccan H9N2 virus may have originated, before spreading to the other African countries. Our study is the first comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary history of the H9N2 viruses in the country, highlighting their zoonotic potential and pointing out the importance of implementing effective monitoring systems.},

In December 2021, three distinct regions of Burkina Faso, namely, Gomboussougou, Bonyollo, and Koubri, detected HPAI H5N1 viruses in poultry. Whole genome characterization and statistical phylogenetic approaches were applied to shed light on the potential origin of these viruses and estimate the time of virus emergence. Our results revealed that the HPAI H5N1 viruses reported in the three affected regions of Burkina Faso cluster together within clade 2.3.4.4b, and are closely related to HPAI H5N1 viruses identified in Nigeria and Niger in the period 2021–2022, except for the PA gene, which clusters with H9N2 viruses of the zoonotic G1 lineage collected in West Africa between 2017 and 2020. These reassortant viruses possess several mutations that may be associated with an increased zoonotic potential. Although it is difficult to ascertain where and when the reassortment event occurred, the emergence of a H5N1/H9N2 reassortant virus in a vulnerable region, such as West Africa, raises concerns about its possible impact on animal and human health. These findings also highlight the risk that West Africa may become a new hotspot for the emergence of new genotypes of HPAI viruses.},

Results: Sequencing of nasopharyngeal swabs at three time points demonstrated dynamic changes in the viral population, with the emergence of 26 amino acid mutations and two deletions, 57 of them in the Spike protein. Such a combination of mutations has never been observed in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages detected so far.

In autumn 2021, HPAI H5N1 caused a series of mass mortality events in farmed and released pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in a restricted area in southern Finland. Later, in the same area, an otter (Lutra lutra), two red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and a lynx (Lynx lynx) were found moribund or dead and infected with H5N1 HPAI virus. Phylogenetically, H5N1 strains from pheasants and mammals clustered together. Molecular analyses of the four mammalian virus strains revealed mutations in the PB2 gene segment (PB2-E627K and PB2-D701N) that are known to facilitate viral replication in mammals.
