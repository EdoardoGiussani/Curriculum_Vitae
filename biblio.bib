  abstract = {The molecular pathogenesis of chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer (NK) cells (CLPD‚ÄêNK) is poorly understood. Following the screening of 57 CLPD-NK patients, only five presented STAT3 mutations. WES profiling of 13 cases negative for STAT3/STAT5B mutations uncovered an average of 18 clonal, population rare and deleterious somatic variants per patient. The mutational landscape of CLPD-NK showed that most patients carry a heavy mutational burden, with major and subclonal deleterious mutations co-existing in the leukemic clone. Somatic mutations hit genes wired to cancer proliferation, survival, and migration pathways, in the first place Ras/MAPK, PI3K-AKT, in addition to JAK/STAT (PIK3R1 and PTK2). We confirmed variants with putative driver role of MAP10, MPZL1, RPS6KA1, SETD1B, TAOK2, TMEM127, and TNFRSF1A genes, and of genes linked to viral infections (DDX3X and RSF1) and DNA repair (PAXIP1). A truncating mutation of the epigenetic regulator TET2 and a variant likely abrogating PIK3R1-negative regulatory activity were validated. This study significantly furthered the view of the genes and pathways involved in CLPD-NK, indicated similarities with aggressive diseases of NK cells and detected mutated genes targetable by approved drugs, being a step forward to personalized precision medicine for CLPD-NK patients.},

  title    = {Lack of viral load within {CLPD-NK} cells: what's outside the leukemic clone?},
  abstract = {Large granular lymphocyte leukemias (LGLL) are sustained by
                proliferating cytotoxic T cells or NK cells, as happens in
                Chronic Lymphoproliferative Disorder of Natural Killer cells
                (CLPD-NK), whose etiology is only partly understood. Different
                hypotheses have been proposed on the original events triggering
                NK cell hyperactivation and transformation, including a role of
                viral agents. In this perspective, we revise the lines of
                evidence that suggested a pathogenetic role in LGLL of the
                exposure to retroviruses and that identified Epstein Barr Virus
                (EBV) in other NK cell leukemias and lymphomas, and focus on the
                contrasting data about the importance of viral agents in CLPD-NK.
                EBV was detected in aggressive NK leukemias but not in the
                indolent CLPD-NK, where seroreactivity against HTLV-1 retrovirus
                envelope BA21 protein antigens has been reported in patients,
                although in the lack of clear evidence of HTLV infection. We next
                present original results of whole exome sequencing data analysis
                that failed to identify viral sequences in CLPD-NK. We recently
                demonstrated that proliferating NK cells of patients harbor
                several somatic lesions likely contributing to sustain NK cell
                proliferation. Thus, we explore whether ``neoantigens'' similar
                to the BA21 antigen could be generated by aberrancies present in
                the leukemic clone. In light of literature and new data, we
                evaluated the intriguing hypothesis that NK cell activation can
                be caused by retroviral agents located outside the hematopoietic
                compartment and on the possible mechanisms involved with the
                prospects of immunotherapy-based approaches to limit the growth
                of NK cells in CLPD-NK disease.},
